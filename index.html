  <h2>ReadingðŸ“–</h2>
  <p>
	My favorite book is Gonna with the Wind. Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell was first published in 1936. Set in Georgia during the American civil war in the mid 19th century, the book takes place on a plantation owned by the O'Hara family - the eldest daughter of which is 16 year old Scarlett. After she is rejected by her love, Ashley Wilkes, she very briefly meets Rhett Butler, a man with a reputation for seducing young women, who has overheard her conversation with Wilkes. Stung by the rejection, and after learning that war has been declared and young men are going to have to enlist, she accepts a proposal from Charles Hamilton. They marry but Scarlett is soon left a widow with a young baby and is expected to wear black and mourn. However, she is not inclined that way, and as the story continues, she flouts the rules of society at every turn, using her charms to get what she wants. The woman who Wilkes married, Melanie, becomes her protector and in many instances saves her from falling from grace. Eventually Scarlett marries Rhett but ultimately the marriage is not a happy one - a tragedy, years of hurt and neglect, and Scarlett convincing herself that she still loves her childhood sweetheart make for a sad ending to the book. Synonymous with the film of the same name starring Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh, the book earned the author a Pulitzer prize in 1937. The title of the novel comes from the poem 'Non Sum Qualis Eram Bonae sub Regno Cynarae' by Ernest Dowson.

  <h2>SingingðŸŽ¤</h2>
  <p>
    I'm passionate at Singing. Jay Chou is my idol! Jay Chou Chieh-lun is a Taiwanese singer-songwriter. Regarded as one of the most successful and influential singers in the Chinese-speaking world, he is often referred to as the King of Mandopop. Chou's works, which often blend Eastern and Western styles, has been recognized for its impact on fashion and musical trends in the Greater China region.
